# Please download the Markdown version
The .docx format can't be created directly in this environment.
Please download the Markdown version from src/documentation.md and convert it to .docx using a document converter or by:

1. Opening documentation.md in a word processor like Microsoft Word
2. Saving as .docx format

Alternatively, you can copy the content and paste it into a new Word document.
